                    </header>

                    <section class="post-content">
                        <p>
                            This project tackles the complex challenge of automating the scanning of building exteriors using a mobile robot equipped with a 360-degree laser scanner. The core goal is to generate an efficient, collision-free, closed-loop path that ensures comprehensive coverage while respecting the scanner's physical limitations and the environment's constraints.
                        </p>

                        <h2>1. Project Goal & Environment</h2>
                        <p>
                            The primary objective is to find an optimal path for a mobile platform to scan all exterior facets of designated buildings within a 2D environment. This environment contains the target buildings (polygons to be scanned), obstacles (polygons that impede movement and visibility but are not scanned), and free space. Input geometry is typically provided via CSV files (<code>buildings.csv</code>, <code>obstacles.csv</code>) defining polygon vertices in a counter-clockwise order for exteriors.
                        </p>

                        <h2>2. Scanner and Path Constraints</h2>
                        <p>Several key constraints must be satisfied:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scanning Angle:</strong> Viewpoints must view a surface segment within a maximum deviation angle (<code>max_angle_deviation</code>) relative to the segment's normal vector.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scanning Range:</strong> Viewpoints must be within the scanner's operational minimum (<code>min_range</code>) and maximum (<code>max_range</code>) distance from the target surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Line-of-Sight (LoS):</strong> The path between the scanner viewpoint and the target segment must be clear of obstructions (buildings and obstacles).</li>
                            <li><strong>Collision Avoidance:</strong> The robot's path must maintain a minimum <code>safety_margin</code> from all buildings and obstacles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Path Type:</strong> The final path must be a single, continuous closed loop, starting and ending at the same point.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimality:</strong> The path should primarily minimize travel distance, but also incorporate penalties to encourage efficient scanning (e.g., minimizing building switches, preferring adjacent segment scans).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>3. Methodology: A Multi-Stage Heuristic Approach</h2>
                        <p>
                            Due to the problem's complexity, a multi-stage heuristic approach was developed, breaking down the problem into manageable steps:
                        </p>

                        <h3>Step 1: Viewpoint Candidate Generation (<code>main_step1.py</code>)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Identifies feasible Initial Viewpoint Candidates (IVCs) for each building boundary segment.
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Discretize Boundaries:</strong> Building exteriors are divided into small segments (<code>boundary_step</code>).</li>
                                <li><strong>Calculate Normals:</strong> Outward-pointing normals are computed for each segment (see Figure 1).</li>
                                <li><strong>Sample Feasibility Region:</strong> Potential viewpoints are sampled around each segment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Check Feasibility:</strong> Each candidate is checked against range, angle, LoS (<code>is_los_clear</code>), and collision (<code>is_collision_free</code> with <code>safety_margin</code>) constraints. Figure 2 shows an example feasibility region.</li>
                                <li><strong>Select IVC:</strong> One representative IVC is chosen per segment from feasible candidates (e.g., using <code>centroid</code> or <code>min_angle</code> method via <code>planning: ivc_selection_method</code>). The selected IVCs are shown in Figure 3.</li>
                            </ol>
                             Outputs include <code>initial_viewpoints.csv</code> and processed data like segments and normals.

                                <li><strong>Calculate Penalized Cost Matrix:</strong> Cost between IVC<sub>i</sub> and IVC<sub>j</sub> includes Euclidean distance plus penalties for switching buildings, visiting non-adjacent segments, and direct line collision.</li>

                                <li><strong>Iterate & Slide Window:</strong> Moves a window along the TSP sequence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Generate Neighbors:</strong> Generates and checks feasible neighbor candidates around IVCs in the window.</li>

                            After refinement, this step attempts to reduce redundancy. It checks if some refined viewpoints can cover multiple nearby segments adequately, allowing removal of unnecessary viewpoints from the tour, further shortening the path (Figure 6).

                        <p>
                            The project is organized into main scripts for each step (<code>main_step1.py</code>, <code>main_step2a_global_tsp.py</code>, etc.) and supporting modules in <code>src/</code> for loading data, geometry, A*, refinement, pruning, utilities, and visualization. The tree structure shows the organization of configuration, data (raw, processed), main scripts, outputs (CSVs, visualizations), and source code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Setup:</strong> Requires Python and libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Shapely, SciPy, python-tsp, PyYAML, tqdm). Configuration is via <code>config/simulation_params.yaml</code>. Input data in <code>data/raw/</code>. Run main scripts sequentially.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            This project provides a robust and modular framework for generating scanning paths for mobile robots in environments with obstacles. The multi-stage approach allows tackling the complexity systematically, and the generated visualizations clearly illustrate the process. While refinements and extensions are possible, the current implementation successfully demonstrates a viable solution for automated 3D data acquisition planning.
